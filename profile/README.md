**PSI is a research-focused aerospace student group at POSTECH in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.**

It was founded to:

- Give any POSTECH student who is interested in aerospace a chance to share aerospace knowledge.
- Provide opportunities to participate directly in real development and fabrication.

Core principles:

- Develop capability as aerospace researchers.
- Avoid pure hobby focus; prioritize research-centered work.
- Provide design and manufacturing opportunities on actual vehicles and systems.
